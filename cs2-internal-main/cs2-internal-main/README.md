# CS2 Internal/External Hybrid Cheat

An advanced Counter-Strike 2 hybrid cheat designed with stealth, stability, and adaptability in mind. This project blends internal and external cheat methodologies, combining high performance with strong anti-detection techniques.

> **Disclaimer:** This project is for educational purposes only. I do not condone cheating in multiplayer games. Use at your own risk.

## Features

### Keyauth Login System
- **Keyauth Library:** Uses the keyauth library to provider a user login system. So far thats all there is for keyauth.

### Security & Stealth
- **PE Header Wiping:** Erases PE headers post-injection to prevent memory scanning.
- **Unlink From PEB Lists:** Unlinks the module from the process's loader lists (InLoadOrder, InMemoryOrder, InInitializationOrder).
- **Debug Directory Wipe:** Clears debug information from the module to obscure its presence.
- **Import Table Wipe:** Removes import descriptors after resolving them to avoid static analysis.
- **Spoofed Execution Thread:** Creates a fake thread under the target process to evade thread-based detection.
- **Streamproof:** Fully Streamproof et all times, including startup.

### Auto-Offset Management
- **Offset Auto-Updater:** Uses an [a2x dumper](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper) to always stay updated with the latest CS2 structures and addresses.

### Hybrid Injection Design
- **Internal/External Fusion:**
  - Supports DLL injection into target processes with stealthy memory and thread manipulation.
  - Automatically hijacks a valid handle from the target (e.g., CS2) and duplicates it to prevent permission issues.
  - Cleanly manages thread execution within the spoofed context of the target process.

### Undetectable Overlay
- **Usermode Overlay Rendering:** Utilizes a stealth overlay method that avoids typical detection vectors used by anti-cheats (e.g., no window hooks, layered window obfuscation).

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11 x64
- Administrator privileges (for handle and memory operations)
- Visual Studio 2022 (C++17 or higher)

## Injection Modes

| Mode        | Description                                                                                                           |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hybrid      | Injects a DLL directly into the CS2 process and read/write memory externally using a handle that belongs to the game. |
| External    | Executes core logic from a separate process using a handle that belongs to the game.                                  |
| Fallback    | Capable of many configurations including fallback to OpenProcess if a handle cant be hijacked                         |

## Injection Methods
- Use [Extreme Injectr](https://github.com/master131/ExtremeInjector) or [Xenos x64](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos) for injecting the dll. Sometimes injections are buggy and can cause it to crash.
*Crashes are common. I threw this together in a day. Ill go back through and fix code sometime haha.*

## Usage

1. **Build** the solution using Visual Studio.
2. **Launch CS2** and leave it running.
3. **Inject DLL or Run EXE** (manual map injection recommended for stealth).
4. The cheat will:
   - Hijack a valid handle.
   - Duplicate and use it for further operations.
   - Launch a spoofed thread in the context of CS2.
   - Render overlay and execute logic.

> **Disclaimer:** If you use your own version of keyauth, i believe you have to disable the modify thread in the keyauth-cpp-library for dll's to work

## TODO
- Add Features Lol (rn its barebones, but the offsets that it has rn are enough to make glow esp with.)
